## Enable SSL with Nginx

`SSL` (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server (a website hosted on vm) and a client (browser) or a mail server and a mail client. It allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely.

`SSL` is an essential part of securing your IIS 10.0 site and Win Server 2016. It is important to know how to set up your environment so that you can take advantage of the security that SSL/TLS provides. This guide will show you how to set up a site to use SSL/TLS with Nginx.


- SSL as a security protocol is deprecated and replaced by TLS (Transport Layer Security). However, the term SSL is still used to refer to the protocol.

- `Browser SSL Capabilities` : Browser support for SSL/TLS is very good. All modern browsers support SSL/TLS.


### How SSL Create Connection ?

- The browser requests a secure page (usually https://).
- The web server sends its public key with its certificate.
- The browser checks that the certificate was issued by a trusted party (usually a trusted root CA), that the certificate is still valid and that the certificate is related to the site contacted.
- The browser then uses the public key, to encrypt a random symmetric encryption key and sends it to the server with the encrypted URL required as well as other encrypted http data.
- The web server decrypts the symmetric encryption key using its private key and uses the symmetric key to decrypt the URL and http data.
- The web server sends back the requested html document and http data encrypted with the symmetric key.
- The browser decrypts the http data and html document using the symmetric key and displays the information.
- The symmetric key is discarded.



### Generate a self-signed certificate

```bash
# go to the nginx directory
cd /etc/nginx

# create a directory for the certificates
sudo mkdir ssl

# go to the ssl directory
cd ssl

# generate a self-signed certificate
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt

# generate a strong Diffie-Hellman group
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 2048

# list the content of the ssl directory
ls -l /etc/nginx/ssl

# total 12
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1704 Sep  5 15:58 dhparam.pem
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3243 Sep  5 15:58 nginx-selfsigned.crt
# -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1704 Sep  5 15:58 nginx-selfsigned.key
```


### Configure Nginx to use SSL

```bash
# go to the nginx directory
cd /etc/nginx

# open the nginx.conf file
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf


# add the following lines to the http block
http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;


    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name 192.168.200.10;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key;

        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;

        root /var/www/siteweb-agence-voyage/;
    }


# cd into nginx configuration directory
cd /etc/nginx/

# test nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t


# reload nginx
sudo nginx -s reload
```



# restart nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
